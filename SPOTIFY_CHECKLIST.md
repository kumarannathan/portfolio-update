# âœ… Spotify Integration Checklist

## What's Been Done:
- âœ… Created `.env` file with your Spotify Client ID
- âœ… Integrated Spotify API service
- âœ… Added "Currently Listening" section to personal panel
- âœ… Configured automatic environment detection (dev vs production)
- âœ… Set up OAuth flow with proper redirect URIs

## Your Credentials:
- **Client ID**: `99e521c45a3e4cbfbdf1d8432b78507a`
- **Client Secret**: `c1a7dde267574a65a37d132114bda402` (stored in `.env`)
- **Dev Redirect**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Prod Redirect**: `https://kmrnn.dev`

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Verify Spotify Dashboard Settings
Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

Make sure BOTH redirect URIs are added to your Spotify app:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `https://kmrnn.dev`

### 2. Restart Your Development Server
The `.env` file needs to be loaded:
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### 3. Test It Out!
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Look for the "who i am offline" panel on the right
3. Click "Connect Spotify"
4. Authorize when redirected to Spotify
5. Play a song on Spotify
6. Watch it appear in your portfolio! ðŸŽµ

## How It Works:
- Updates every 5 seconds automatically
- Shows album art, track name, artist, and album
- Only shows when you're actively playing music
- Token stored in browser localStorage
- Works in both development and production

## Troubleshooting:
- **"Connect Spotify" button not working?** â†’ Make sure you restarted the dev server
- **Redirect error after authorization?** â†’ Check that redirect URIs are added in Spotify Dashboard
- **Nothing showing up?** â†’ Make sure music is actively playing on Spotify (not paused)
- **Token expired?** â†’ Click "Disconnect" then "Connect Spotify" again

ðŸŽ‰ You're all set! Just restart your server and click "Connect Spotify"!
